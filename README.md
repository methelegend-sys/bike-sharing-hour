After installation, open anaconda prompt from your start menu.

Run these commands in anaconda prompt, they should all execute successfully and they all require active internet connection.

1. conda create -n py35 python=3.5
This will create a new python environment with python 3.5 installation, we need python 3.5 so that we can install and run all libraries.

2. conda activate py35
